# HTML Email Templates & Design System for Figma and Sketch


## How To Use This Kit

The email templates designed in these files are available as HTML/CSS templates at HTMLemail.io

Use this as a boilerplate to help you design out new email templates that are consistent and aligned with the larger design system you’ve agreed on with your developer(s).


## Styles

Styles contains your reusable color styles and type styles. In Figma these are controlled by variables.

You should update the colors to match your own color palette. Remember to change the name of the style and replace the hex color value for reference.

You should update the fonts to match your own font stack. Currently this kit uses Helvetica. Helvetica is a standard system font and supported in all email clients.

There are also rules for spacing. 8px is the unit of spacing and any space should be a multiple of 8 e.g. 8px, 16px, 24px


## Components

Components are reusable blocks throughout your templates. In Sketch they are represented as symbols. In Figma they are components.

You can override certain attributes of these components e.g. text, color

There are a handful of default components designed to suit your needs. Once you define your own layout you may want to turn those into components and combine them with these defaults.


## Layout + Grid

This is your reusable desktop and mobile layout.

This kit sticks to a 600px width for convenience. In our experience it is safer to stick to a fixed width. Of course you can design beyond this if you choose to.

This kit uses a 6 column grid. The gutters are 48px and the columns are 52px. These are represented by the layout grid. The offset or padding around the content is 24px. This is represented by the red guidelines.

On mobile this kit assumes 6 columns will collapse into 1 column and stack.


## Templates

This is the meat of the file. You’ll find 10 email templates, with desktop and mobile versions.

The templates that are there today are typical email templates most startups and web applications will need. Use these as a starting point and inspiration for your email designs going forward.

This kit and HTMLemail.io in general purposely sticks to clean simple email templates so you can use them as a boilerplate to build upon and be more creative if you choose to.
